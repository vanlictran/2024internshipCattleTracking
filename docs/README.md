### Internship2024_M1Report_BEUREL_BOULTON_numer7.pdf
This file was the first step we made during this internship. Before start coding and working with the hardware, we made this document which explains the project and the different steps we will have to do during this internship. You can find some interesting information in such as :
- The context of the project
- The objectives of the project
- The hardware we will use
- The original planning
- etc....
Please note that this document was made at the beginning of the internship and some information could be outdated.
### Report_for_Vietnmese_students.pdf
At the end of the internship, some Vietnamese students helped me on the IoT part and also for printing the 3D box. They had to do a report about their work, so they asked me a document which can summarize what did I do during my internship. This report is a good summary of the project and it could be useful if you want to have a quick overview of the project. You can find some information such as :
- LoRaWAN part in summary 
- How I use accelerometer's data 
### RSSI-Based_Localization_using_LoRaWAN_Technology.pdf
This document is a scientific paper which explains how we can use LoRaWAN technology to make a localization system. This document is fascinating because it explains how we can use the RSSI value to make a localization system.
