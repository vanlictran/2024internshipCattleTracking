# 3D_Box
This repository is used for stock some useful files about the box we made during the internship. You can find the 3D files, the STL files, the GCODE files, etc...
## Architecture 
### STL Folder 
This folder contains all the STL files we used to print the box. The original files can be found on this link https://www.printables.com/fr/model/650031-box-organizer-krabicka-different-sizes/files. In our case, we just made some changes on the bottom part of the box to add some holes for the cables.
### GCODE Folder
This folder contains all the GCODE files we used to print the box. The GCODE files are the files which are used by the 3D printer to print the box.
## How use the 3D Printer
If later you want to print some new parts and you got only the STL files you can follow these steps to print the box:
1. Open the STL file with the 3D Software ELEGOO Cura 
2. Check the settings of the 3D printer
3. Save the file as GCODE (don't forget to check the settings like support, etc...)
4. Put the GCODE file on the USB key
5. Insert the USB key on the 3D printer
6. Select the PLA mode on the 3D printer for heat the printer
7. Select the GCODE file on the 3D printer
8. Start the print
